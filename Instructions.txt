step 1:Clone the repository 

step 2:Collect images dataset 
Use jupyter notebook or python script for collecting images 4 key depedencies cv2, os(help with the file paths), time(to have break in-between collection of images) ,uuid(to name image path)
5 signs ['hello','thanks','yes','no','iloveyou']
Cv2.videocapture (to start capturing in webcams)
images will be collected into their respective named folder which would later be transfered to collectedImages folder

step 3:Setup LabelImg
Clone the below repository
LabelImg:https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg

step 4:Label Images
To label images we use labelImage package 
Split into training and testing dataset

step 5:Updated labelmap
new file in annotations folder called “lab_map.pbtxt” has all the label map annotations

step 6:Train the model
Clone the below repository
Tensorflow object detection api:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection
Train steps =20,000 , loss=0.099

step 7:Update checkpoint

step 8:Detect
final testing of the model
